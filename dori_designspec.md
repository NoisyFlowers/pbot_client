Forms:

Homepage: inlcuding logos, sleek images, and portals to the following informational pages and the thre primary portals:
  -About page (project overview, project personnell, funding sources, how to cite, metrics of use (some summary metrics could also populate to homepage) 
  -How-To page (where tutorials live, in multiple formats and languages)
  -Registration page
  -log-on (only necessary for entering data, could be on portal II instead)
  -(I) Database search portal (explore)
  -(II) Data Entry portal (takes to researcher's "workbench")
  -(III) Education portal 


I. Database search portal
  -simple and advanced query options
  -search within PBot or link(?) search to PBDB (for example, for mapping purposes)
  -output data formats, has options online and downloads. Customize download fields (e.g., which characters)
  

II. Data Entry Portal ("The Workbench")
  (once logged-in, the workbench home page reflects summary data from your entries? or customized to show your most recent entries, or something like that?) 
 Functions/portals to new pages:
 II.A. Enter new taxon record (takes you through a series of pages for data entry). Have option to make public/private.
    1. New Morphype/species -or- Propose new occurrence of existing taxon. 
    2. Exemplar Specimen(s)
      -link to iDigBio or existing record to pull specimen metadata (i.e. geology) and images
      -not avail on iDigBio: enter the data manually - use all needed Darwincore fields for occcurrence records, repository, specimen(s)
    3. Customize entry options - choose your schemas. 
      -preservation type
      -broad group/clade
      -(should the above result in a suggestion of applicable schemas? or just show all possibilities)
      -select (like checking boxes) character schema(s) to apply (can hover, or "view schema" to have a look during the selection process)     
    4. Schema entry (enter states for the characters of selected schema) - this may be just one html entry page that you scroll till finished or multiple pages (one per schema?) that you enter data into - not sure what is easier developement-wise
    5. Diagnosis (how to structure?)
    6.
 
 
 II.B Comment on records 
      -search for and pull up record(s)
      -add forum comment to taxon record
 
      
 II.C. Enter new schema (this could just, or also, be an option under II.A.3, so it is streamlined if you are mid-entry)
      -New schema (set of characters) vs additional states to existing schema vs add-on characters to existing schema




III. Education Portal
-possibly subdivide by education level: general, K-5, 6-9, 10-12, college, etc.)
-place for lesson plans and/or project ideas for educators to be available
-any community-data entry project outlines/instructions/etc. 
-glossary of terms (this will be linked from the data entry portal too, but there should be a master list of definitions here)




*Questions:
1) browsing your own entries (dataset)- is this all done through the main search functions (i.e., you restrict the search to your locality, or by enterer) 
2) somewhere should the schemas be available to explore without it being within the "enter data" portals
